    "# String slicing allows you to extract a part of a string by specifying a start position, an end position, and an optional step value. Think of a string as a list of characters, and slicing helps you pick a subset of those characters.\n",

    "# Q6. Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples and sets are both fundamental data structures in Python, and they serve different purposes. Here’s a detailed look at their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples :\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Immutable Collections : Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they are created. This immutability is useful when you want to ensure that a collection of items remains constant throughout the program. For example, you might use tuples to represent fixed configurations or records that should not be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Multiple Return Values : Functions in Python can return multiple values as a tuple. This is a common pattern for returning multiple pieces of related information from a function. For instance:\n",
    "def get_min_max(numbers):\n",
    "    return (min(numbers), max(numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Dictionary Keys : Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries. This is not possible with lists, which are mutable. For example, you might use a tuple to represent a coordinate in a grid:\n",
    "grid = {}\n",
    "grid[(1, 2)] = \"value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Data Records : Tuples can be used to group related data together. This is particularly useful in cases where you want to return a record-like structure without defining a custom class. For instance:\n",
    "person = (\"John\", \"Doe\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Iteration : Tuples can be used in iteration to unpack values conveniently. For example, when iterating over a list of tuples:\n",
    "for name, age in [(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25)]:\n",
    "    print(name, age)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sets :\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Unique Elements : Sets are used to store unique elements. They automatically remove duplicates, which is useful when you need to maintain a collection of distinct items. For instance:\n",
    "unique_numbers = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "   # unique_numbers will be {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Membership Testing : Sets provide an efficient way to test membership. Checking if an item is in a set is generally faster than checking if an item is in a list. For example:\n",
    "unique_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "if 2 in unique_set:\n",
    "    print(\"2 is in the set\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Set Operations : Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations are useful in scenarios where you need to compare and combine collections of data. For example:\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "union = set1 | set2        # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "intersection = set1 & set2 # {3}\n",
    "difference = set1 - set2   # {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Removing Duplicates : Sets are useful for removing duplicates from a collection. If you have a list with duplicate items and you need a list with only unique items, you can convert it to a set and back to a list:\n",
    "list_with_duplicates = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n",
    "unique_list = list(set(list_with_duplicates))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Performance Considerations : Sets are implemented using hash tables, which generally offer faster membership testing and element addition/removal compared to lists, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary:\n",
    "# Tuples are great for fixed collections of items and data that should not change, while sets are ideal for collections of unique elements and efficient membership testing. Each data structure has its own strengths and is suited for different types of tasks in Python programming."

    "# 1. Adding Items :\n",
    "\n",
    "# To add a new item to a dictionary, you simply assign a value to a new key. If the key doesn’t exist, it will be created along with its value.\n",

    "# 1. Stable Lookup : Dictionaries use a system called hashing to quickly find values associated with keys. For this system to work properly, the key must not change. If the key were allowed to change, the dictionary wouldn’t be able to find it efficiently, leading to errors or slower lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Consistency : Immutable keys ensure that once a key is set, it remains the same. This consistency helps keep the dictionary reliable, as the key will always point to the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Efficiency : With immutable keys, the dictionary can perform operations like searching, adding, and removing items quickly and effectively. Changing keys could disrupt these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of Immutable and Mutable Keys :\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutable Keys :\n",
    "\n",
    "# Immutable keys include types like strings, numbers, and tuples (as long as the tuples contain only other immutable types). These types can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: Using Strings as Keys :\n",
    "# Using a string as a key\n",
    "person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
    "    print(person['name'])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Using Tuples as Keys :\n",
    "# Using a tuple as a key\n",
    "locations = {(37.7749, -122.4194): 'San Francisco', (34.0522, -118.2437): 'Los Angeles'}\n",
    "    print(locations[(37.7749, -122.4194)])  # Output: San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable Keys :\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable keys, like lists and dictionaries themselves, cannot be used because they can change, which would make the dictionary unreliable.\n",

    "# Example 1: Lists as Keys (not allowed) :\n",
